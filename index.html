<!--
Refresh the app to see changes
Only electron based code in index.js needs requires a rebuild

Tradition html buttons (input elements) can be used if all
that is needed is for the user to specifically select a file

Electron buttons will be needed however if the application needs
access to files on the fly without input from the user

Electron apps can access everything a typical browser could and also
everything node related

With Electron we want to keep everything webish in index.html, everything else
in the index.js electron logic, so that the code is reusable for the web
